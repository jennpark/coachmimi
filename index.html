                <h3>What Is Christian Life Coaching?</h3>
                <p class="mb0">Christian life coaching is holistic Christ-centered coaching that applies biblical wisdom to daily life issues. There are many differences between Christian coaching and secular coaching. First, Christian coaching is Christ-centered. Second, in Christian coaching, there is a three-way relationship between the client, the coach, and the Holy Spirit. Secular coaching involves a two-way relationship between coach and client. 
    <br>
    <br>Life coaches work with clients in all areas of life including business, career, finances, and relationships.&nbsp;As a result, clients set better goals, make better decisions, take more action, and are more fully aware of their true strengths. <br><br></p>

    <br>
    <br>Today Coach Mimi conducts life coaching sessions primarily through the telephone. When she is not coaching, she enjoys spending time with family. She has been married since 1981 to her loving husband, and they currently reside in Orange County, California with their adorable poodles, Brownie and Cookie.

                            <p class="mb80 mb-xs-24">Early one morning a man was walking along the beach.
                            <br>Watching the ocean waves breaking on the shore, and he saw a most unusual thing.
                            <br>He saw that the beach was littered with thousands of starfish that had been washed up on shore and were dying in the sun. Far down the beach in the distance, he could see a young woman picking up starfish and throwing them back in the ocean, one at a time, When he was close enough to her to be heard above the waves the man said, “You’re wasting your time. There are thousand of starfish here. You can’t possibly make any difference.”
                            <br>The young woman reached down, picked up a starfish, and threw it as far as she could, back into the sea. “I made a difference to that one,” she said, and she reached down to pick up another.&nbsp;<br><br>-from "Co-active Coaching"</p>
